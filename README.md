# First-Time-Machine-Learning-Engineer

Welcome to the **First-Time Machine Learning Engineer** repository! This resource is designed for beginners who want to dive into the practical and technical aspects of deploying machine learning systems. If you're curious about the engineering side of ML and want to learn how to bridge the gap between models and production, this guide is for you.

## üìå Objective

To provide a structured roadmap and essential resources for transitioning from theory to practice in machine learning engineering. This includes hands-on tools, coding examples, and best practices to operationalize ML models.

## üõ†Ô∏è What You‚Äôll Learn
- Key concepts in machine learning engineering (model lifecycle, deployment, and monitoring).
- Using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and MLFlow for production-ready systems.
- Coding pipelines with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
- Cloud platforms for ML (AWS, GCP, Azure) and their services.
- CI/CD for ML workflows and handling model updates.

## üå± Progression Pathway
1. **Foundations**: What is machine learning engineering? Overview of ML systems.
2. **Model Building**: Refresh on basic machine learning concepts.
3. **ML Pipelines**: Automating workflows using Python and tools like Airflow.
4. **Model Deployment**: Using Flask/FastAPI for APIs, deploying with Docker/Kubernetes.
5. **Monitoring**: Building feedback loops, model drift detection.
6. **Projects**: End-to-end system demonstrations for practice.

## ‚ú® Outcome
By following this guide, you will:
- Understand the lifecycle of machine learning systems.
- Gain experience with tools for model deployment and monitoring.
- Learn to scale ML workflows in production environments.
- Build end-to-end ML systems to showcase your skills.
